# CSV_to_HTML
CSV->HTML converter

Imagine your company uses a server that runs a service called ticky, an internal ticketing system. The service logs events to syslog, both when it runs successfully and when it encounters errors.
The service's developers need your help getting some information from those logs so that they can better understand how their software is used and how to improve it. So, you'll write some automation scripts that will process the system log and generate reports based on the information extracted from the log files.

# To do:
*	Use regex to parse a log file
*	Append and modify values in a dictionary
*	Write to a file in CSV format
*	Move files to the appropriate directory for use with the CSV->HTML converter

ticky_check.py script will create the following reports:
*	The ranking of errors generated by the system: A list of all the error messages logged and how many times each error was found, sorted by the most common error to the least common error. This report doesn't take into account the users involved.
*	The user usage statistics for the service: A list of all users that have used the system, including how many info messages and how many error messages they've generated. This report is sorted by username.

# You can visualize the __error_message.csv and user_statistics.csv by converting them to HTML pages. To do this, pass the files one by one to the script csv_to _html.py file
## ./csv_to_html.py error_message.csv /var/www/html/<html-filename>.html
Replace <html-filename> with the name of your choice.
## ./csv_to_html.py user_statistics.csv /var/www/html/<html-filename>.html
Replace <html-filename> with the new name

Now, to view these HTML pages, open any web-browser and enter the following URL in the search bar. [linux-instance-external-IP]/[html-filename].html


# Use this command  to run the changing:
./csv_to_html.py user_emails.csv /var/www/html/html-filename.html  # Replace html-filename with the new name.

# How it looks like after changing:
